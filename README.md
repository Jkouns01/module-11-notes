<h2> What did I learn? </h2>
<p> I really struggled with this module becaus eI feel that the content was not thoughly explained to me or my class.<br>
the only thing I really learned was the app.get and app.push. <br> I was unable to submit it to heroku because I never recieved the email to set it up and use the credits. I was not going to pay for it for this challenge.
